about half cooked, add beef. When the mixture is about medium, drain the

then add the cream cheese and beat until smooth. Add the brown sugar and
vanilla and process for several minutes, or until the batter is very
smooth. Beat the egg whites and fold into the cheese mixture. Set aside.
PREPARE THE CRUST:  Soften butter and combine with graham cracker crumbs.
Mix until fully blended, e.g. they will form a ball when squeezed in your
hand or by a spoon. Pat the crust into the sides and bottom of a springform
pan about 9 inches in diameter.
Spread a generous layer of chips on the bottom of the pan, and then pour
the batter into the pan. Add another generous layer of chips to the top of
the cake.
Place the filled pan into the preheated oven.  Baking time will vary from
about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Cooking time depends on whether you want a
soft, gooey ""New York"" style cheesecake (shorter) to a fluffy
""souffle""-like cheesecake (longer). The longer you cook it, the fluffier it
gets.
When the cake starts to rise like a souffle, start checking to see if it is
done.  It will just about double in volume, and should not flow over the
sides of the pan. If the cake shimmers like Jello when shaken, it is done.
Alternatively, if a knife inserted comes out clean, the cake is overcooked:
the knife should be very lightly coated with batter."

of waxed paper or plastic wrap. With a mallet, pound the chicken breast 1/8
inch thick. Continue in the same way until all the breasts are flattened.
Set aside until ready to cook, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
When ready to cook the fajitas, finely grate the onion. In a large
nonreactive dish, mix the onion and its juice with the orange juice and
soy. Remove the waxed paper or plastic wrap, and place the chicken in the
onion-orange-soy mixture. Turn to coat both sides. Set aside to marinate
for at least 15 minutes and up to 45 minutes, turning once or twice.
If grilling, prepare a charcoal fire and allow the coals to burn until they
are mostly covered with white ash and a few red spots show through here and
there. This will take about 40 minutes. When the fire is ready, place the
chicken breasts on the grill rack, directly above the coals. Cook until no
longer pink, but still moist in the center, about
1 1/2    minutes on each side.

medium-heat until the oil begins to smoke. (You can use one frying pan to
save on dishes and cook the fajitas in several rounds.) Add as many chicken
breasts as will fit in one uncrowded layer. Cook until no longer pink but
still moist in the center, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Remove and
drain off any liquid from the pan. Continue cooking another round until all
the breasts are cooked. Cut the chicken into thin strips. To assemble,
place about 1/3 cup of chicken in the middle of a tortilla. Top with some
shredded lettuce, sour cream, and Green Olive-Cilantro Salsa. Fold and

spoon. Continue to boil rapidly for 15 minutes, skimming, then reduce the
heat; cover the pot and simmer for 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Season with salt to
taste -- about 1 tablespoon. Strain the broth through a sieve lined with
several thicknesses of cheesecloth into a large bowl and cool thoroughly in
the refrigerator. Save the gizzards (they are good eating) and discard the
other chicken parts and the vegetables. When the stock is cold, remove the
layer of fat that has formed on the surface. You will have about 2-1/2
quarts of stock. It is a great aid and comfort to always have on hand good
home-made beef, chicken or veal stock, but you have to be realistic. You
must gauge your stock-making by the space you have to keep it in. Two or
three days is about as long as you should keep stock in the refrigerator;
if you keep it longer you should remove it and boil it up again before
using. If you want to keep it for much longer periods of time, freeze it.
You can safely keep stock frozen for up to three months. * Double Chicken

that forms on the surface; reduce the heat; cover and simmer gently until
the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour for a young chicken, or 2 to 2-1/2
hours for a fowl. Remove the chicken and either serve it as poached chicken
or remove the skin, take the meat from the bones and use it for chicken
dishes ~- a chicken salad, hash, chicken pie, or creamed chicken. Strain
the broth through several thicknesses of cheesecloth into a bowl; let cool,

Meals and Meditations, compiled by United Methodist Women, Rockville, IN.
>From Fred Peters:
Broth: 1 chicken (about 5 lb) 2 1/2 quarts water
Soup: 3/4 c butter (room temperature) 3/4 c flour 2 c light cream (OR
half-and-half) 6 c chicken stock, heated 1 1/2 c cooked chicken breast,
finely chopped Salt, to taste, if desired Freshly ground black pepper, to
taste 1 c fresh parsley, snipped, to garnish
Broth:  Simmer the chicken  for about 1 hour.  Remove the chicken and cool;
remove the meat from the bones.  Reserve the white meat and save the
remainder for other uses.
Soup:  Blend the butter and flour together in a mdm (3-quart) saucepan.
Warm the cream in a seperate pan.  Add the warmed cream to the butter-flour
mixture and stir until smooth.  It will start to thicken when it is heated.
Stir in two c of the hot stock. Cook over low heat, stirring, until heated
through and blended, about 4 minutes. Add an additional 4 c of stock and
the chopped chicken. Season to taste with salt, if desired, and pepper.
Heat to serving temperature--steaming, but not boiling or the cream will
break. Watch the pot closely to keep from coming to a boil.
Serve from a heated tureen and ladle into heated bowls. Garnish with
snippets of fresh parsley.

(about 2 minutes, shaking pan frequently to avoid burning). Set aside. **
Note: I have often used leftover shredded cooked chicken (especially
poached without oil), but you can stir-fry in the following manner: Mix
together flour, cornstarch and salt. Dredge chicken in flour mixture; shake
off excess. Pour oil in pan. Add chicken and stir-fry (about 5 minutes, or
until pink is gone. Drain and cool. Meanwhile prepare dressing and set
aside. Shred lettuce. Place lettuce, chicken, green onion, and cilantro
leaves in large bowl. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, drizzle with dressing and
toss. Sprinkle rice noodles on top of each serving AFTER applying dressing.
Adapted from a Sunset recipe. Judy Garnett,Raleigh,NC If desired,
substitute honey for the sugar. Leftover grilled chicken in strips is good
in this also."

edges, but will still seem undercooked. As it cools, it will sink in the
center. This is correct! Let the dessert cool completely in the pan on a

Serve Simply: Remove from refrigerator at least one hour in advance. Cut in
wedges and pass lightly sweetened whipped cream and sauces separately. To
Serve More Formally: Whip cream with remaining 3 Tbsp sugar and mask
cake thickly with about 3/4 of it. Scrape the remaining
whipped cream into pastry bag and pipe large rosettes or swirls around the
top edge of the cake."

Whisk yeast into 1 1/4 cups milk. Add milk and yeast mixture, eggs, and
melted butter to the flour mixture. Stir until well blended. Add 1 cup
flour and stir until the dough pulls away from the bowl. Now it's ready to
be kneaded. While kneading, slowly add remaining flour. To knead, fold
dough in half. Give it a quarter turn. Push into the dough with the heel of
your hand, then repeat kneading steps for about 8 minutes. Place dough in
greased bowl and cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size --
about 2 hours.
CARAMEL SAUCE: While dough rises, make sauce. Place brown sugar, butter,
and cream in saucepan. Stir over medium heat just until melted and
combined. Take pan off heat and stir 1 cup chopped pecans into the caramel
sauce. Set the sauce aside. Now make the cinnamon filling.
CINNAMON PECAN FILLING: Mix together in a bowl, the sugar, butter, and
cinnamon. Reserve the 1 cop pecans to sprinkle over filling.
MAKING THE ROLLS: Roll out the sweet dough. Spread cinnamon mixture on
dough, then sprinkle with pecans. Roll the dough. Make sure you keep it
tight to make a compact swirl. Use a dough scraper to help roll and to
loosen from surface. Seal the roll by pulling the open edge up and pinching
the dough together with your fingers.
Before cutting individual rolls, divide prepared caramel sauce equally
between two 9-inch round pans, greased with butter. Now you are ready to
cut the rolls. Use a ruler and knife to mark every 1 1/4 inches. Cut dough
in half. Cut rolls with lever-action and place 7 in each pan. Cover and let
double in size in a warm place (1 1/2 - 2 hours). Place pans on bottom rack
of oven and bake at 350 F. for 20 - 25 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove rolls from the oven and place on cooling rack. IMPORTANT: Let rolls
sit in the pan, undisturbed, for about 15 - 20 minutes. After the rolls
have cooled, place a serving platter upside down over pan. While holding
the pan and platter together, carefully (sauce is hot) flip them over so
the serving platter is on the bottom. Slowly lift pan away. The sticky buns
will be on the platter with the warm caramel sauce on top.

chef Seppi Renngli at the Four Seasons. In a skillet large enough to hold
the fillets melt about 3 tablespoons butter and, when almost sizzling, add
trout.  Saute on one side for about 3-minutes, turn, cover for a minute,
and then saute the other side. A total of 6-7 minutes should do it.
Salt and pepper the fish and remove to a warm place, add nuts for a
moment to the pan to toast, then toss over the trout fillets.
Meanwhile, in a separate small, sturdy pan, heat enough oil so that a
small strainer can be lowered into it.
Let capers drain in the strainer.
Returning to the trout pan, splash in tablespoon or two of wine, then add
stock and cream and boil down rapidly, stirring in just a taste of the
tomato paste and a little more butter. When reduced and slightly thickened,
spoon this little bit of pan sauce over the fillets.
Now quickly lower the capers into the almost smoking oil. Let them
sputter and sizzle a few seconds, then remove the strainer and shake free
of oil.  Distribute fried capers in neat piles at either end of the fillets
and serve immediately."

Garlic Roaster;Enjoying your progressive;Garlic roaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"NORMA WRENN
This unique terracotta baking dish will enable you to roast garlic bulbs to
perfection, the extra large size allow you to also roast giant ""Elephant
Garlic"" and onions. Be sure to read the instructions carefully for best
results. BEFORE FIRST USE: Wash garlic roaster with warm water. AFTER EACH
USE: Wash glazed surface of garlic roaster plate with warm soapy water and
rinse thoroughly. Wash dome with warm water only. (Avoid using soap on
unglazed porous surfaces as they might absorb a soapy taste.) Do not use
harsh abrasive cleaners, brushes or steel wool. NOT DISHWASHER SAVE. TO
OVEN ROAST GARLIC: 1. Soak terracotta dome in cold water for 15 minutes.
(This step is optinal, but will make the garlic more moist. The garlic bulb
will roast without soaking the dome.) 2. Cut top 1/2"" to 3/4"" off of a bulb
of garlic exposing the clove tops. (If using Elephant Garlic, slice off
about an inch or more.) 3. Remove some of the loose outer skin (but not
all) leaving the bulb intact. 4. Place garlic onto plate and pour
approximately 1 tablespoon of olive oil on top of the bulb (optional). 5.
Cover with dome and starting in a cold oven, bake for 50 to 60 minutes at
325 degrees. 6. Serve the roasted garlic whole. Squeeze each clove and
spread soft garlic onto hot crusty french bread rounds or crispy crackers.
FOR MICROWAVE: Prepare garlic bulb and soak dome as directed above and cook
for 5 to 6 minutes on medium or 2 to 3 minutes on high. You may have to
cook the garlic for up to 50 seconds more, depending on the strength of
your microwave. Great for use in dips and dishes.
TO OVEN ROAST AN ONION: Wash a medium sized onion, butter the glazed plate,
and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1-1/2 hours until tender. Slice
off the root end (abut 1/4"") and squeeze soft onion out from skin. Great
topping for seafood, steaks, and poultry, or add to pasta, omelettes,
sandwiches etc.
SPICY IDEAS: After pouring the olive oil over the bulb of garlic, you may
add a sprig of fresh herbs such as parsley, rosemary, basil, oregano, or
spinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of dried herbs for an extra zesty flavor. Roasted
garlic is a wonderful addition to sauce, dips, salads, breads and of course
pasta!

up around the filling. Then tuck one edge of the husk over the top of the
tamale and roll, tying the ends with strips of corn husks. If preferred,
the bottom end of the husk can be folded up before rolling. If you plan to
freeze the tamales, freeze them at this point.

Home-Candied Angelica;1 lb Angelica;1 lb Granulated sugar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The most important thing about candying angelica is to choose stalks that
are young and tender.  In other words, angelica is only worth candying in
April or May when the shoots are new and softly coloured. Trim the young
shoots into 3-4 inch lengths, put them into a pan, cover with water and
bring to a boil.  Drain and scrape away tough skin and fibrous threads with
a potato peeler, rather as you might prepare celery. Return the angelica to
the pan, pour on fresh boiling water and cook until green and tender. If
the shoots are as youthful as they should be, this will take 5 minutes or
less.  Drain the stalks and dry them.  Put them into a bowl and sprinkle
granulated sugar between layers, allowing 1 pound of sugar for every 1
pound of angelica. Cover and leave for 2 to 3 days. Slide contents of the
bowl into a heavy-based pan.  Bring very slowly to the boil and simmer
until the angelica feels perfectly tender and looks clear. Drain, then roll
or toss the shoots on greaseproof paper thickly strewn with sugar, letting
the angelica take up as much sugar as will stick to it. Then dry off the
angelica - without letting it become hard - in the oven, using the lowest
possible temperature.  I place the stalks directly on the oven shelves
(with trays underneath to catch any falling sugar) and find they need about
3 hours.  Wrap and store after cooling completely. Packed into pretty
little boxes, home-candied angelica makes a charming present."

How To Melt Chocolate;No ingredients;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL MELTING:
Follow directions carefully.
Do not overheat; these products scorch easily.
Microwave directions have been tested with microwave ovens ranging from 500
to 700 watts (output). Times given are to be considered guidelines;
microwave ovens differ in timing and heating patterns.
Stirring frequently is important whether using rangetop directions or
microwave directions. In the microwave oven, chocolate and other chips will
keep their shape and may not appear melted after heating, but will become
fluid after stirring.
Handle glass microwave dishes with a hot pad after melting; the container
may be hotter than the contents.
Wash and dry the melting utensil thoroughly after each use. Any residue
will affect the taste of the chocolate.
Do not allow chocolate to come in contact with moisture during melting
since this can cause lumping, tightening or ""seizing."" If this occurs, add
one or two tablespoons shortening, such as CRISCO, for every six ounces
chocolate; stir until fluid.
Do not use butter or margarine since these may contain water. Do not use
oil since this may prevent the mixture from setting up which is especially
important if it is being used for a glaze.
Break baking chocolate or candy bars into pieces to speed the melting
process."

mint in for 5 minutes longer.)

dissolved. Add ice water and lemon or lime juice. Stir well and pour into

potatoes (about 2 lbs). Boil in salted water until tender (30 minutes or
so?).  Drain and peel. Return to pan and mash over low heat with a potato
masher until no lumps remain. Remove from heat and mix in 1 egg yolk,
lightly beaten, and about a cup of flour. When well blended, turn onto a
floured board and knead in more flour (may take as much as another cup,
probably more like 1/2 cup) until soft and pliable but not too sticky. Cut
in 4 pieces and roll each into a rope about as thick as your thumb. Cut
into 1"" lengths. Hold a fork, tines down, on the board with the curved side
away from you.  Roll each piece against the tines to make the little
indentations about 1/2 way round and curve slightly (you really don't have
to do this but it looks cute, and IS authentic). Place on a floured baking
sheet as you do them. You can either cook right away or keep a few hours,
uncovered, in the fridge.  Try this sauce over them: Melt 1 tbsp butter in
a medium pan.  Add 1 clove garlic, very finely minced. Stir a couple of
times and add 1 cup heavy cream. Cook, stirring constantly, until reduced
to about 3/4 cup.  Add 4 oz Gorgonzola and stir until melted. Now drop the
gnocchi into boiling salted water and cook until they just rise to the top,
1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a heated platter with a slotted spoon or skimmer
as they come up.  Pour the sauce over them and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
chopped toasted walnuts and serve at once. This is very rich, but

Jalapeno Poppers #2 Pt 1;"175 Whole jalapeno chile pepper; stems removed";8 oz Cream cheese;"8 oz Cheddar cheese; ex. sharp, finely shredded";"8 oz Monterey jack cheese; finely shredded";1/2 cn Beer;;"Vegetable batter; (generic pre mixed)";"Garlic salt; to taste";"Onion salt; to taste";"Black pepper; to taste";"Cayenne; to taste";"White cornmeal; for coating";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"There are essentially 5 functional parts of the perfect popper:
1. The pepper 2. The filling 3. The initial batter 4. The breading 5. The
final batter
The peppers: Fresh jalapenos.
A potato peeler with a pointed end is the perfect tool for deseeding. The
radius of the peeler allows you to make a hole about 1 cm in diameter,
which is optimized for efficient seed removal, effective stuffing of
popper, and minimal leakage (more on that later). Stab the pepper adjacent
to the stem, with the stem on the concave side of your peeler, remove, turn
pepper roughly 1 radian and repeat. After 3 or 4 stabs, you will have
seperated the stem from the rest of the pepper. Pull out, with slight
twisting motion, and you will remove most of the seeds. A little additional
scraping may be required to get out the innards. Put aside and repeat until
done.
The filling: Mix equal weights of cream cheese, finely shredded cheddar
(sharp or v.sharp), and finely shredded Monterey jack. My batch used 8
ounces of each. Mix these together in a bowl, until additional mixing makes
no change in consistency.
The batters: Both of them have basically the same ingredients. The
differences are in consistency (and time of preparation). Don't use milk
for the batter. It won't grab the pepper, because of the waxy consistency.
Beer works best of beer, water, & milk. Use generic fried vegetable batter
(I used the Chuck Wagon stuff), and an equal part of flour. Season with
garlic salt, black pepper, onion salt, and powdered cayenne for color (both
in the batter and in the unsuspecting faces of your guests). I used about 1
teaspoon of each to about 1/2 cup each of chuck wagon stuff and flour.
For the initial batter, you want it very thick, thicker than pancake
batter. This is to hold the breading to the popper. If you add too much
beer at the start, add flour to thicken. I think it took about half a beer
for this.
For the final batter, you want it very thin, it should take less than a
second for the batter to 'climb' the tines of a fork when removed and held
vertically over the batter. This has an added bonus of making those little
crunchy things to eat with the poppers. This was still less than a whole
beer, so don't get too carried away- make it thick and add the beer in
small amts. Remember, don't make this until you're serving them!
The breading: Just a plate with a pile of white cornmeal, dry.
The process: After coring a sink full of peppers, stuff them all full of
the cheese. Use your pinkie to pack the cheese in good, leaving about a 1/4
inch divot on the end of the pepper (recessed cheese, in case I'm not being
clear). Then line up your thick batter and corn meal, and an oven tray
lined with aluminum foil. Dip the pepper in the batter, holding by the
cheese and tip ends. Allow as much of the excess batter as you can stand to
drip off. Then place the pepper in the corn meal. Pick up a handful of meal
and bury the pepper. Place your hand on top of the pile (cupped), and apply
some light pressure to help everything pack together. Pick up the pepper
and shake off the excess meal. Again, handle the pepper by the tips, it
helps minimize the bald spots. Place the pepper on the tray, and repeat a
million (OK, 200, but it seems like a million) times. Place the pan in the
freezer. This is called flash freezing. After about half an hour (the time
it takes to fill the next tray) remove the first tray, and place all of the
poppers in a big ziplock bag. Put the bag back in the freezer. Wait
overnight or longer.
The serving of and eating of poppers: Heat up grease in your fry daddy.
Make the final (thin) batter. Get some of your frozen poppers. Some of the
breading may have come off in spots, don't sweat it. Dip the popper in the
thin batter and put in the grease. Cook until golden brown. Conveniently,
this is also the point where the cheese is melted, yet the pepper isn't
overcooked. Pop in yer mouth.
Possible variations: A friend suggested that the initial batter/breading
might have nothing to do with the success of the final batter sticking,
that the freezing may be the trick there. If true, It would save a lot of
work! I haven't had a chance to try it yet. Please tell me how these turn
out when you try them!

batter.  Pour one-quarter cup of batter on dry, hot griddle like you would
for pancakes, and cook similarly until golden brown.
Method 2:  Mix with *just* enough water to make a thick, slightly crumbly
dough.  Pat into flat cakes and cook on a dry, hot griddle until golden
brown.
Historical note:  The reason why they're called ""johnny cakes"" is that when
the pioneers were going West across the Plains, they had to cook over an
open camp fire at night, and eat left-overs for breakfast and lunch. So,
the pioneer women would make a thick corn dough, press the cakes on the
flat bottom side of a hoe, and prop the hoe next to the fire so that the
cakes could cook (they didn't have griddles-natch!). These cakes would be
used on the trail next day for lunch (stashed in your pocket so you could
eat it on horseback), and were call ""journey cakes"", which eventually got
corrupted into ""johnny cakes""."

Kai Kem (Salty Eggs);4 c Water;1 c Salt;9  Duck eggs or chicken eggs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Perry Lowell
This Chinese invention is loved by Thais, who serve
salty eggs as a contrast to the incendiary heat of a
green curry or a bland dish.  Kai kem is traditionally
made with duck's eggs, which are cured for several
weeks in a simple salt brine.  Once cured, they keep
for many months at room temperature, and are boiled
when it's time to eat them.
In a medium saucepan, combine the water and salt and
stir well with a large spoon to dissolve some of the
salt.  Place over medium heat and bring to a boil,
stirring frequently.  After mixture boils rigorously
for about 1 minute, remove from the heat, stir once
more, and cool to room temperature.
Gently arrange the eggs in a crock or large jar.  Pour
the cooled brine over the eggs, making sure they are
completely submerged. Cover and keep in a cool place
for 1 month.
When you're ready to use the eggs, place the number of
eggs you want in a small pan and add cold water to
cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When the
water reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to low
and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool
to room temperature. Peel and serve.
Note:  Salty or Salted Eggs are sold uncooked in Asian
markets.  Often they are covered with 1/4-inch layer
of charcoal colored ash. Rinse off the ash and cook as
above."

combination of lime juice with the lemon juice is very close to the actual
taste of key limes. (Real key limes are hard to come by and expensive, as
well.) Use a hand grater, or, if you have one, a zester, to remove the lime

30 minutes with oven door partially opened. Then add sour cream topping.
3. Carefully run a small paring knife around inside edge of pan once
cheesecake is removed from oven. This helps release cheesecake from pan as
it cools and shrinks, so there's less cracking on top.

Cheesecakes are about as close as you can get to the ultimate dessert, and
this one is no exception. If you've never made a cheesecake before, you'll
be delighted at how simple it is. Best of all-because you need to make the
cheesecake ahead of time so that it has time to cool and set-it keeps you
from last-minute hassles.

Consumer Centers at ConAgrar, parent company  of HEALTHY CHOICE. Made
Christmas Eve '96.  Excellent results, except I didn't give it time in the
refrigerator to set, so it was runny.  I garnished it with raspberries and
sliced kiwi."

I finally found it and we are hooked. Thanks to my
bread maker; we have no excuse for not having a great
homemade pizza in no time. I hope you'll try it out
and let me know how you like it. By the way, this
doesn't make a Pizza Hut type of pan pizza dough,
instead it is a hand-tossed type that is tender and
not tough...delicious! Try it. Another note: I have a
Welbilt 350.
Put all ingredients in your bread maker on manual and
let it do the work. I let it rise for a little longer
after it finishes, but judge for yourself if it
requires that. Divide into two 12"" pies (I roll it
out) Put on two cornmeal covered pans, prick with a
fork, brush with oil, add toppings and preheat your
oven to 500F. Let the pizzas rise for 15 minutes or
so, then bake for 7 minutes. MMMama Mia!! I've gotten
great recipes off this BB, so I thought I'd
reciprocate! Hope you like it!!"

enough rosewater or orangewater (available from pharmacies) to make a
pliable stiff dough. Knead with fingers, then place on board dusted with
confectioners' sugar and form into desired shapes, to resemble miniature
apples, peaches, strawberries or, if you have an artist's touch, little
pigs or birds. Tint with food coloring. Balls of marzipan may be rubbed in
chocolate dots or colored sugar. If dough becomes too stiff, work in a
little lemon juice, rosewater or orangewater, adding drop by drop.
When candies are shaped, dry thoroughly in a cool, airy place for 24 hours,
then wrap separately or place in a container (such as a little straw basket
for fruit) and cover completely with Saran or other plastic wrap.

           ORANGE COMPOTE:
           MILK CHOCOLATE GLAZE:
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: Six 3-inch metal ring molds (1 3/4 inches in height).
Make the milk chocolate cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and
preheat to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter an 11 1/2-inch by 17 1/2-inch
jellyroll pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Butter the paper
and dust the bottom and sides with cocoa powder, lightly tapping out the
excess. Set the pan aside.
Melt the chocolate according to the directions in the Chocolate Key. In a
large stainless steel bowl, vigorously whisk together the egg yolks and the
almond extract until the mixture is thick, about 1 minute. Set aside.
In the bowl of a food processor, combine the toasted almonds and the flour
and process until the nuts are ground to a fine powder. In a 4 1/2-quart
bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the
butter on medium speed until it is pale and soft peaks begin to form, about
3 to 5 minutes. Lower the speed, add the zest and the almond flour and mix
until well combined, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the reserved chocolate, then
the yolks, mixing just until combined.
In a dry, grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer with
the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites on low speed until frothy.
Increase the speed to medium and beat until soft peaks begin to form, 2 to
3 minutes, then gradually add the sugar. Increase the speed to high and
continue to beat until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks when the
whip is lifted, 1 to 2 more minutes.
Using a large rubber spatula, mix 1/3 of the whites into the
chocolate-almond-butter mixture to lighten it . Gently and quickly fold in
another third of the whites. Fold in the remaining whites. Scrape the
batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly with an offset metal
spatula. Bake for 30 minutes until the cake springs back when lightly
touched and the sides pull away from the pan. Cool in the pan for 10
minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack and remove the parchment paper.
When the cake has cooled, cut out 18 cake rounds using a 3-inch by 1 3/4-
inch metal ring mold. Set the cake rounds aside until ready to assemble the
dessert.
Make the milk chocolate-orange cream: Place the chopped chocolate into a
medium stainless steel bowl. In a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a
boil. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the cream over the chocolate.
Allow the mixture to stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate; whisk
gently until smooth. Stir in the orange liqueur. Refrigerate until
thoroughly chilled."

Author's Notes:
For years my mother required us to taste her ever-changing version of a
fresh cranberry relish she insisted serving at Thanksgiving and Christmas.
The unanimous family response to the inevitably bitter dish was, ``Do we
have to?''  Then one year a friend came to Thanksgiving dinner and
contributed what is now known simply as ``the recipe.''  Mom never tried to
improve on this addictive relish.
The most difficult step is in unmolding the relish.  I always spray my
mold very lightly with a coating of an aerosol cooking oil (such as
``PAM'') before filling it with the relish.  When it's time to unmold, I
run a thin spatula around the outside of the molded relish to barely loosen
it, place the serving plate on top and invert the mold and plate. I rarely
have to dip the mold in hot water to loosen the relish. I usually use a
standard ring mold and put the dressing in a footed compote which sits in
the center of the unmolded ring of relish.
Difficulty    : moderate. Precision
: approximate measurement OK."

No Meat Bean Burn Pizza;"1  Boboli (Bobali; Bobili, ?) 15-inch bread crust";1 cn Refried black beans (or roll your own);"1 c White cheese; or more (take your pick; this is a guideline)";"1 c Yellow cheese; or more";Tomato sauce or decent pizza sauce;;"Chiles: fresh Habs; or other very hot; pungent";"Chiles: fresh Jalapenos; etc., less hot";"Tomatoes; sliced thin";Green peppers sliced or chopped;"Onions; scallions, whatever you like";Mushrooms;Pineapple (maybe for some);Olives;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This is not so much a specific recipe as it is a guideline for how to
create an excellent veggie pizza with a good long hot burn.
The day before the feast, get the refried beans ready.  There are several
brands of low-lard black refried beans available; I suggest you buy a
premium one. Mix the beans with chopped habs or whatever chile you have.
How hot to go? The beans mellow the heat, so go by your experience, and add
a little. Hot pungent chiles are best here as the heat mixes with the beans
provides a Much better effect. Mix every 6 or so hours while keeping in the
icebox. (Maybe pre- heating the bean/chile mix would make this process go
faster?) Anyway after 18 or so hours, it's time to make the pizza.
Pre-heat to 350 F. Layer the special refried beans over Boboli, and cover
with the sauce.  Pile on a layer of cheese.  Next 1/2 the veggies, dull
colors first. Now the rest of the cheese and then the colored veggies. On
top go the 'mild' chiles. How much? how thick? Did you ever make a pizza?
Cook for about 20 minutes, but keep an eye on it.  Too thick of beans,
cheese, veggies will cause the crust to burn before the cheese boils.  And
too little 'stuff' will cause the center to cremate before crust is done."

There are
several regional variations, indeed it has been said that Thailand has a
different curry for every day of the year, but a different pad thai for
every cook in Thailand! This is my wife's variation.
This variation uses a small amount of khao koor (powdered fried rice),
which occurs as an ingredient in several other Thai recipes. You can make a
small amount and keep it almost indefinitely in a jar with a tight lid.
You also need a cup of dry roasted, unsalted peanuts.  We roast them in
their shells on a charcoal brazier, but you can do it just as well in an
oven, or even in a skillet. However, they should be freshly roasted to
bring out the full flavor for this dish.
NOTE: rice vermicelli (either the sen mee or the sen lek style of Thai
noodles or indeed any rice noodles will do).  These should be soaked for a
short while (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the brand of
noodles) until soft.
Method: Heat a little cooking oil in a wok and add the garlic and shallots,
and briefly stir fry until they just shows signs of changing color.  Add
the remaining ingredients except the egg and the bean sprouts, and stir fry
until the protein ingredient is nearly cooked. Continuing to stir with one
hand, slowly ""drizzle"" in the beaten egg to form a fine ribbon of cooked
egg (if you don't feel confident with this make an egg crepe separately,
and then roll it up and slice it into quarter inch wide pieces, which you
add to the mix at this point). Finely add the bean sprouts and cook for no
more than another 30 seconds. Remove from the pan to a serving platter.
Garnish: Mix a tablespoon of lime juice with a tablespoon of tamarind juice
and a tablespoon of fish sauce, and use this to marinade half a cup of
uncooked bean sprouts, half a cup of chopped chives, and half a cup of very
coarsely ground roasted peanuts.  Sprinkle this mixture on the cooked pad
thai.  Cut several limes into segments and also slice up some cucumber into
rounds then halve the rounds.  Put the lime segments and cuke segments
around the serving platter.
You can also sprinkle a quarter of a sliced up banana flower and some
Indian pennywort leaves over the top as edible decoration.
Pad thai is served as above, but Thais add copious amounts of the four
basic condiments (chilis in fish sauce, ground dried red chili, sugar and
crushed peanuts) at the table, to suit their individual predilections."

the eggplant pulp and set it aside. In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet heat 4
tablespoons of the olive oil over moderate heat until a light haze forms
above it.  Add two eggplant shells, cut side up, and, shaking the pan
occasionally to prevent them from sticking, cook over low heat for 5

adding more oil to the pan if necessary. Then arrange the 4 shells cut side
up in a baking dish large enough to hold them snugly. Preheat the oven to

2. Gently saute the onion in a little oil until it softens, then add the
garlic and crushed red peppers.  Cook another few minutes, but don't let
the garlic brown.
3. Add the fennel and stir.  Cover and sweat until the fennel softens,
about 10 minutes.
4. Add the tomatoes and orange zest.  Simmer uncovered for about 15
minutes, then salt and pepper to taste.  (If you're using cream, stir it in
after about 10 minutes, then let the sauce continue to simmer another 5
minutes or so.)
5. Give the sauce a 5 or 10 minute head start, then cook the pasta. When
it's done, drain and combine the pasta and sauce in the large pot. Stir to
coat the pasta evenly and let it cook a moment so the spaghetti absorbs a
little of the sauce.  Then dump it into a serving bowl, scatter parsley
over all, and serve.
Note on Fennel:  It's sometimes marketed as anise.  The bulb is the best
part.  Standard procrdure for fennel is to whack off the stalks, quarter
the bulb lengthwise and cut out the base like you would for cabbage. At
that point it's ready for slicing or dicing.
Having said the bulb is the best part, I should say that there's nothing
wrong with the stalks.  in fact, if you were stuck with a small bulb, you
can dice a stalk and use it in this recipe.  The major difference is that
the stalks are more fibrous, like celery.  Actually, the stalks are pretty
good to eat raw instead of celery (provided you like licorice)."

sugar, tapping out excess.
For the batter, in a large mixing bowl, beat the 5 egg whites with the salt
and lemon juice until foamy. Very gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and continue
beating the whites until they form stiff, but not dry, peaks.
Use the same beaters and another bowl to beat the 5 egg yolks and
additional egg with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and lemon rind until very
light and fluffy.  Gently but thouroughly fold the beaten whites into
yolks.  Fold in chocolate and nuts, and pour batter into pan.
Bake torte in a preheated 325 degree oven for 50-55 minutes or until top
springs back when gently pressed.
[this will not rise as much as you think it ought. Don't worry about it]
Leave the torte in the oven, turn off the heat, and open the door slightly.
After 10 minutes remove torte from oven. Run a knife around the edge of the
torte to release it from the pan rim.  Cool it for another 30 minutes in
the pan. Remove the pan rim and cool the torte completely on the bottom.
[This next part is for icing the Torte.  What I've done in the past is make
2 layers, following the above directions, doubled the amount of raspberry
syrup and dribbled half over each torte as per the directions and skipped
the jam. I've then used the chocolate glaze as an icing for between the
layers, and the ""Instant"" Chocolate Mousse recipe for the outside icing of
the whole thing.  ]
Cover a 9 or 10 inch cardboard circle with heavy duty aluminum foil or
freezer paper or use a cake plate. Invert torte onto base and remove pan
bottom. Sprinkle wine [or whatever] evenly over torte. Heat jam until
thinned; then bruch or spread it all over the torte. (this adds flavor and
smooths the surface).
For the glaze, combine the water, oil, sugar, and cocoa in a small suacepan
and mix very well.  Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly,
for 10-14 minutes, or until the glaze thickens slightly and is very smooth
and shiney.  For the best flavor and texture it should not boil. Remove
glaze from heat and stir 3-4 minutes longer until it cools slightly and
gets a bit thicker. Pour all the glaze in the center of the torte and
immediately use a metal or rubber spatula to evenly spread it all over top
and sides.  Wipe up any drips from base.
Let torte rest a few minutes until the glaze begins to set, but is still
soft.
Press handfulls of ground nuts all over the sides, but not the top. Arrange
whole nuts, evenly spaced in circle on top about 1 inch from edge. Heap
chocolate curls or bits in center.
Refrigerate the uncovered, completed torte for several hours or,
preferably, overnight so the glaze will set and the flavors and textures
will ""mellow"".
(Once the glaze has set, the torte can be frozen for up to 3 weeks. Freeze
it uncovered, then wrap it in plastic wrap or tin foil. Unwrap it before
thawing and thaw for several hours in the refrigerator."

Phulka;3 c All-purpose flour;1/4 ts Salt;"1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil; heated";1 1/2 c Water;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This is a simpler, lighter version of the chappati and somewhat quicker to
make.
Yield: 12 phulkas
MAKING THE DOUGH: Combine salt and flour and heap this mixture in a bowl.
Make a well in the middle and add oil. Work flour and oil together, as for
pastry dough, and then add 1 cup water. Mix and knead the dough, aiming for
an homogeneous mass. Add more water (about 1/2 cup), a little at a time,
kneading to absorb the moisture until the dough is soft but not sticky. It
is the right consistency if, when poked with the index finger, a little
indentation is made but the dough does not stick to the finger.
ROLLING THE PHULKA: Pinch off enough dough to make a ball 1 1/2 inches in
diameter. Flatten ball and dip into white flour. Lightly flour a surface
for rolling out the dough. Roll into a circle about 6 or 7 inches in
diameter.
COOKING THE PHULKA: Heat the griddle and begin to cook as for chappati:
spread the rolled-out phulka onto the griddle. It's color will change to a
slightly darker shade within 30 seconds. Slide the chappati to the edge of
the grill with your fingertips (this is a skilled task and requires
asbestos fingers), pick it up and turn it over. Let it cook another 30
seconds or so, until small blisters or bubbles appear on the surface. When
both sides have been cooked once, if using a gas stove,remove the griddle,
turn down the heat, and put the phulka DIRECTLY ON THE FLAME! It should
balloon into a spherical shape. Turn, cook the other side, remove from
heat, and crush to remove the air and maintain it in a soft and flexible
condition for eating.
If cooking on an electric stove, keep the phulka on the griddle. It may not
balloon up, but it will still be very good to eat. Cook both sides until
little, light brown patches appear.
Serve hot, brushed with a dab of ghee or margarine.
Phulkas do not store as well as chappaties. They tend to become brittle or
rubbery if kept overnight."

Preheat the oven to
400*F. Grease a baking sheet. In large bowl, combine the beans, feta, lemon
juice,dill,pepper and garlic.( Use filling immediately or it will become to
watery.) Take 3 sheets of phyllo dough and lay them out lengthwise. To keep
remaining phyllo sheets from drying out, cover them with a damp cloth. With
a pastry brush, brush 1 phyllo sheet with melted butter, cover it with a
second sheet, repeat the brushing and stack to make a stack of 3 sheets.
Cut the stacks in three 4-inch wide strips. Be sure to work quickly so the
edges don't dry out. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of filling on the lower
left corner of 1 strip. Fold the right corner of the dough over the filling
to the left edge, forming a triangle. Continue folding the dough in this
triangle pattern until you reach the end of the strip. Put filling on the
other 2 strips and repeat the folding. Place triangles on baking sheet.
Remove 3 more sheets from their damp cloth covering and repeat the entire
process until all phyllo is gone. If freezing the triangles, cover them
with plastic wrap and place them in the freezer. Brush tops of triangles
with remaining butter and bake 12 - 17 minutes, or until golden brown. Let
stand 15 minutes before serving so the filling cools a little. Makes 12
triangles. Great appetizers."

add some corn starch, and maybe some more sherry. After another minute or
so, Add a large squirt of Frenches Mustard. Things should take on a yellow
tint now. Add small can of Pineapples (Juice and all) to the mix. Let
simmer until sauce thickens (cover wok if possible-the thai peppers will
steam and have a softer, blended flavor). Spoon onto noodles and enjoy."

Cooks Notes: I found this recipe book years ago at the library. I made this
recipe and fell in love. I later bought both part I and part II of these
cookbooks. These are the foods that they serve at their wonderful
restaurant in Portland, Oregon.
Over the years, I have adjusted the ingredients. I don't use the Salsa or
any salsa on it. This chicken has a Mexican flavor. At times, I have
changed the ingredients; added cilantro, done without the parsley, the
Tabasco, oregano.
I don't bother using toothpicks or anything. I just tuck everything closed
and then put them in the baking pan tucked side down. They ooooze cheese no
matter what you do! Yum.
Italian Variation: When I had leftover spaghetti sauce and extra mushrooms
~ - I made it ITALIAN! I left out the cumin and chili powder (used Italian
seasonings instead and changed the cheese to mozzarella, the green chili to
mushrooms and put spaghetti sauce on top.)
Freezer info: Also, we often partially cook these (about 30 minutes)and
then freeze them and then thaw and bake for about 20 minutes. We take
(frozen) camping. (Have not frozen the Italian variation that I invented.)"

Mix yeast into warm water. Leave the yeast 5-10 min to bubble and add to
the flour, with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix roughly in a bowl,
then put in the food processor, and process, adding a LITTLE more water if
it won't form a ball. Turn out in the bowl, which has had a teaspoon of
olive oil put in it. Roll the ball in the oil, cover loosely, and leave
until risen (depends on the weather, but I find an hour is enough).
Spread out in your pizza platter (ceramic if possible, see above), and it
will begin to rise again while you potter around the kitchen, finding
whatever ingredients are available to make fridge pizza.

Arrange chilies on a baking sheet and broil until charred
on all sides, turning occassionally -about 20 minutes. Enclose in paper bag
and let stand 10 min, to make skin easier to remove. Peel chilies. Cut one
lengthwise slit in each chili and carefully remove the seeds. Meanwhile
heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions
and saute until golden, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread onions evenly in 13x9x2 glass baking dish (this provides a bed to
keep the chilies from sticking and burning, along with adding flavor).
Preheat oven to 350F. Mash half the beans with the cayenne in a medium
bowl. Mix in remaining beans. Spoon mixture into chilies. Arrange chilies,
seam side down, atop the onions. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover with foil (can
be made 4 hours ahead and chilled at this point). Bake chilies, covered, 15
minutes. Uncover and bake another 5 minutes or so, until the cheese melts.
Serve with salsa and sour cream.
OK, I would probably skip the char and peel with the smaller chilies. And
just stuff them with cheese, or a mixture of cheese and cream cheese. I
would only make a small slit to do this, to avoid problems with losing the
filling. To get a crust without deep frying, I would dip them in beaten
egg, then roll them in crumbs. Flavoring the crumbs with a bit of cayenne
or using finely crushed tortilla chips instead of crumbs would be nice
touches. I probably wouldn't bother with the onion bed, but would grease
the pan well instead. And lay them in it slit side up to keep the cheese
filling in. And probably bake them uncovered (probably about the same 15-20
minutes), to keep the crumbs crisp and melt the filling. Spraying a bit of
margarine or oil on first would add a bit of extra crispy crunch."

Pork Loin Braised in Milk Bolognese Style;1 tb Butter;2 tb Vegetable oil;2 1/2 lb Pork rib roast;Salt;Fresh ground Black pepper;;2 1/2 c Milk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"If among the tens of thousands of dishes that constitute the recorded
repertory of Italian regional cooking, one were to choose just a handful
that most clearly express the genius of the cuisine, this one would be
among them. Aside from a minimal amount of fat required to brown the meat,
it has only two components, a loin of pork and milk. As they slowly cook
together, they are transformed: The pork acquires a delicacy of texture and
flavor that lead some to mistake it for veal, and the milk disappears to be
replaced by clusters of delicious, nut-brown sauce.
Note: The cut of meat specified above includes the rib bones to which the
pork's loin is attached. Have the butcher detach the meat in one piece from
the ribs and split the ribs into two or three parts. By having had the loin
boned, you can brown it more thoroughly, and by cooking it along with the
bones, the roast benefits from the substantial contribution of flavor the
bones make.
Another cut of pork that is well suited to this dish is the boneless roll
of muscle at the base of the neck, sometimes known as Boston butt. There is
a layer of fat in the center of the butt that runs the length of the
muscle. It makes this cut very juicy and tasty, but when you carve it
later, the slices tend to break apart where the meat adjoins the fat. If
you don't think this would be a problem, you ought to consider using the
butt because of its excellent flavor and juiciness. Should you do so,
substitute 2 pounds of it in one piece for the 2 1/2-pound rib roast.
Do not have any fat trimmed away from either cut of meat. Most of it will
melt in the cooking, basting the meat and keeping it from drying. When the
roast is done, you will be able to draw it off from the pot, and discard
it.
1. Choose a heavy-bottomed pot that can later snugly accommodate the pork,
put in the butter and oil, and turn on the heat to medium high. When the
butter foam subsides, put in the meat, the side with fat facing down at
first. As it browns, turn it, continuing to turn the meat every few moments
to brown it evenly all around. If you should find the butter becoming very
dark, lower the heat.
2. Add salt, pepper, and 1 cup of milk. Add the milk slowly lest it boil
over. Allow the milk to come to a simmer for 20 or 30 seconds, turn the
heat down to a minimum, and cover the pot with the lid on slightly ajar.
3. Cook at a very lazy simmer for approximately 1 hour, turning the meat
from time to time, until the milk has thickened, through evaporation, into
a nut-brown sauce. (The exact time it will take depends largely on the heat
of your burner and the thickness of your pot.) When the milk reaches this
stage, and not before, add 1 more cup of milk, let it simmer for about 10
minutes, then cover the pot, putting the lid on tightly. Check and turn the
pork from time to time.
4. After 30 minutes, set the lid slightly ajar. Continue to cook at minimum
heat, and when you see there is no more liquid milk in the pot, add the
other 1/2 cup of milk. Continue cooking until the meat feels tender when
prodded with a fork and all the milk has coagulated into small nut-brown
clusters. Altogether it will take between 2 1/2 and 3 hours. If, before the
meat is fully cooked, you find that the liquid in the pot has evaporated,
add another 1/2 cup of milk, repeating the step if it should become
necessary.
5. When the pork has become tender and all the milk in the pot has
thickened into dark clusters, transfer the meat to a cutting board. Let it
settle for a few minutes, then cut it into slices about 3/8 inch thick or
slightly less, and arrange them on a warm serving platter.
6. Tip the pot and spoon off most of the fat there may be as much as a cup
of it being careful to leave behind all the coagulated milk clusters. Add 2
or 3 tablespoons of water, and boil away the water over high heat while
using a wooden spoon to scrape loose cooking residues from the bottom and
sides of the pot. Spoon all the pot juices over the pork and serve
immediately."

mention it again. I have been carrying my own dressing around for a while
(I have my ff caesar with me today), since I HATE bottled/processed
dressing, most especially the commercial ff versions. Even the non-fat free
ones add sugar, and to me, dressing should be sour/savory, not sweet. What
I do is carry one of those little rubbermaid containers; it holds about 1/2
c. My homemade dressings are mostly vinegar and spices, except for my
caesar, which is mainly egg-beaters, vinegar, worchesteshire sauce, and
teriaki sauce. In fact, I'll post the recipe here.
Mix all ingredients together, pour over crisp romaine lettuce with ff
croutons.
the measurements are approximate, since I just throw everything in a
plastic container and shake! I also use more citrus juice than vinegar,
although the basalmic really adds a nice flavor. Posted to fatfree digest"

RICOTTA FILLING
Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the
eggs, milk, butter and brandy, if using, until blended. Add to the flour
all at once and gently stir with the whisk until blended. Let stand for at
least 1 hour at room temperature. (The batter can be refrigerated, covered,
overnight; stir to blend before using.)
Make berry sauce: In a small saucepan combine water and cornstarch and stir
until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the strawberries or raspberries.
Heat, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens. Remove from the heat
and stir in orange liqueur, if desired. Set aside.
Make ricotta filling: In a bowl, mix together the ricotta, sugar, vanilla,
zest, nutmeg, and optional candied orange rind. Set aside.
Heat a 6 or 7-inch heavy nonstick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat
until hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Brush with a thin film of
vegetable oil, or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Ladle about 3
tablespoons batter (or a scant 1/4 cup measure) into the hot pan and
quickly tilt to coat the pan and make a thin pancake.
Cook the crepe until the edges begin to curl and the underside is golden,
about 1 1/2 minutes. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a thin flexible
spatula or a heatproof rubber spatula and gently turn. Cook the underside
until lightly spotted with color, about 30 seconds. Turn the crepe out onto
a wire rack.
Repeat with the remaining batter, stirring it occasionally. As the crepes
are made, transfer them from the rack to a pie plate. Cover lightly with a
piece of foil and keep warm in an oven set at the lowest temperature. Fill
with the ricotta mixture and drizzle with the berry sauce.
The crepes can be cooled, wrapped in foil and refrigerated for a few days
before reheating in a warm oven. They can also be frozen for at least 1
month. Cool, stack them on top of one another and wrap tightly in foil and
then in a freezer bag. The crepes need no paper between them; they will not
stick together when frozen or refrigerated. They thaw at room temperature
in about 1 hour, and can be reheated right in the foil without unwrapping."

If kabocha squash is unavailable,
you can use buttercup squash, one of the hubbards, or a couple of acorn
squashes. Avoid the blander varieties such as butternut and banana squashes
~- you want rich, sweet flavor for this.
Peel the onions and cut them in quarters, then slice them crosswise. Peel
the Kabocha squash, cutting away any dark-green parts, seed it, and cut the
firm yellow flesh into 1/2-inch cubes.
Heat the oil and butter in a large, preferably non-stick saute pan. Add the
onions and chopped garlic and stir over high heat for 3-4 minutes, then add
the cubed squash, salt, and sage. Continue cooking on medium-high heat,
stirring often, until the vegetables are spotted with golden brown and the
squash is becoming tender -- about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the
vegetable broth to a simmer.
Add the rice to the squash mixture and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Add
the Marsala, stir quickly as it cooks away, then add the white wine.
When the wine has all been absorbed, add about a cup of the hot broth,
along with the balsamic vinegar. Lower the heat to a simmer and stir the
risotto gently with a wooden spoon. As the broth is absorbed, add another
ladle, and then another, always keeping the rice moist, and stirring
constantly or at least very often. Some of the squash will fall apart into
a puree.
Use as much broth as you need to achieve rice that is al dente, tender but
firm, with a creamy sauce around it. It will take about 30 minutes, but
start tasting after 20 minutes.
At that point, correct the seasoning with a touch more salt and some pepper
if needed, and stir in about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Add another
1/2 ladle of broth, stir well, and serve at once in warmed, shallow bowls.
Garnish each serving with slivers of fresh basil, and pass more Parmesan
cheese separately."

stirring frequently. Continue adding remaining stock a half cup at a time
in the same manner, allowing each addition to be completely absorbed before
adding the next half cup. This should take about 25 minutes. Stop adding
stock if the rice begins looking really mushy. It should be tender but
still slightly firm to the bite.
Remove from heat. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, then the
parmesan, lemon peel and remaining prosciutto. Garnish with paper- thin
slices of lemon and/or a few julienne slices of prosciutto, if desired."

Santa Cruz Natto (Fermented Soybeans);2 c Dried soybeans;Water;1 pk Commercial natto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"**Note: Please read the entire recipe first and make a note of the
ingredients and utensils that will be needed. The starter culture must be
obtained from store-bought natto, unless you have other sources such as
rice straw.**
1. Soak two cups of dried soybeans overnight in ten cups of water.
2. Put the soybeans in a stainless steel basket (or colander) and cover it
with a piece of cloth slightly larger than the basket.
3. Put the above in a pressure cooker with 3 cups water, and place it on
the stove. Turn on the stove.
4. After the pressure cooker starts hissing, turn down the flame so that
the hissing is at its minimum level.
5. Cook for 15 minutes (measured from the time the hissing has started).
6. DO NOT OPEN the pressure cooker yet. Allow the pressure cooker and its
contents to cool down. If waiting is not your style, place the pressure
cooker in the sink filled with cold water. (The soy beans are considered to
have cooled down as long as its temperature is below 140 degrees F.)
7. Make sure that the kitchen counter and its surrounding area are
absolutely clean. Sterilize a tablespoon with boiling water.
8. Wash your hands and arms - long-sleeved shirts not recommended.
9. Have a package of commercial natto ready.
10. Open the lid of the pressure cooker, peel back the cloth cover to one
end of the basket, and using the tablespoon, quickly mix in about two
spoonfuls of natto starter with the beans. Replace the cloth cover.
11. Close the pressure cooker lid with its air relief hole _uncovered_.
12. Place the cooker in a picnic ice-chest and place an electric heating
pad over it. Replace the ice-chest cover.
The natto will be ready in between 24 and 48 hours, depending on the
temperature of the heating pad. As an alternate heat source, a 7.5-watt
lightbulb may be used. If you don't have a pressure cooker, a regular pot
may be used. In this case, the cooking time will need to be increased to
about two hours, and the amount of cooking water to about six cups."

not stay at the bottom. After 2-3 minutes, balls will start to float.
Rotate them with chopsticks or a slotted spoon, gently pushing them against
the side of the wok. (This action will help the balls retain a rounder
shape). Continue frying them until the balls attain a medium golden brown
color. (Approximately 8-10 minutes.) Drain on paper towel and cool for 5

you like smoked oysters, try it substituting 2 dozen oysters for the

flavor from the tasso.)
If you can't get tasso, you can substitute a cured smoked ham, but it
really won't be the same.
Pour the cream into a large heavy skillet and place over medium heat. Stir
the cream when it begins to rise to keep it from overflowing; when it comes
to a boil, add the tasso, salt, peppers and herbs and let simmer for 8-10
minutes. The cream sauce should be fairly thick, especially if you're using
oysters (the liquid from the oysters will thin it out). You can prepare the
sauce ahead to this point.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil and drop in the pasta.
Cook until just al dente. Meanwhile, return the sauce to a simmer, stir in
the shrimp (or oysters, scallops, crawfish, etc.), green onions and parsley
and cook until the shrimp turn pink (or until the oysters curl around the
edges), about 3-4 minutes. Drain the pasta and divide among bowls. Ladle
the sauce over and toss; serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Serves

*Baked roux: Lots of Louisiana recipes start with ""First you make a roux. ""
The traditional roux is a mixture of about equal parts of oil and flour
browned to a certain point. A baked roux can substitute nicely in some
recipes. To bake a roux, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Put some (about 1/3
c.) of flour pie pan or cake pan which has been sprayed with PAM. Bake at
400 degrees stirring frequently until roux is caramel colored and just
begins to have a burnt smell. Don't bake it any longer! Store roux in

BROTH
Recipes from Michael Lomonaco's _Michael's Place_, 3/15 and 16/97
Place the shrimp and eggs in a food processor with a metal blade. Pulse
until the shrimp are coarsely chopped. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add
the heavy cream, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper and pulse just to combine.
Don't over-process the cream or you'll wind up with grainy textured cream
or even butter. Remove the mixture to a bowl and add the chopped tarragon
leaves, blending them in wi th a spatula.
Lay out one wonton skin on a board. Using a pastry bag or a teaspoon, place
approximately one teaspoon of the filling in its center. Brush a second
wonton skin with the egg-water mixture and lay over the filling, pressing
lightly with your fingers to remove any trapped air and seal the edges of
the wonton skins. Continue to make ravioli in this manner until all the
filling has been used. The unc ooked ravioli should be stored refrigerated
in a container, sprinkled lightly with cornstarch. They will keep up to two
days in the refrigerator, or for several weeks in the freezer. To freeze,
lay t he ravioli in a single layer on a wax-paper lined sheet pan and place
in a freezer until frozen. They can then be removed and stored in freezer
bags.
Heat the fish stock in a sauce pan and set aside. In another sauce pot heat
the olive oil, add the chopped onions and cook until wilted. Add the
crushed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes before adding the fish stock and
saffron. Continue to cook for 30 minutes until ready to serve.
To cook the ravioli, drop them into boiling salted water and continue
cooking at a boil until they begin to float (about two to three minutes for
fresh ravioli, 5 to 6 minutes for frozen ones). Drain and divide among soup
bowls. Add 1/2 cup saffron broth to each bowl, garnish with a little diced
tomato and some chopped fresh herbs such as tarragon or chives. Serve hot."

Smoke the duck, and debone. Make a duck stock with the bones -- cover the
bones with 4-1/2 quarts water and the end pieces from the onions, celery
and bell pepper. Simmer for 2 hours. Strain and reserve the stock. It is
preferable to do this a day ahead of time, so that the stock may be
refrigerated and defatted.
Place 1 gallon of stock in a gumbo pot and bring to a boil. Add the roux,
Creole seasoning, Tabasco, Worcestershire, white pepper, andouille and half
of the onion, celery and bell pepper (the ""holy trinity""). Simmer for 1
hour.
Add the remaining onion, celery and bell pepper, and 2 cups water. Simmer
for 1 hour. (Adding half of the trinity later in cooking helps keep them
intact, after the first half gives up all their flavor and texture and
disintegrates into the gumbo.)
Dice the duck meat into large chunks, discarding the skin. Add the duck
meat, green onions and parsley. Simmer for 15 minutes.
Serve in gumbo bowls over steamed long-grain rice."
Smoked Trout;Trout;Lime, sliced;Lemon, sliced;Smoking wood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"* Smoking woods can be as varied as Mesquite, Apple, Alder, Hickory, or
any other flavor you like. Soak the wood in water at least overnight. *
You will need a covered grill, (Weber is the best.) * If you use a grill
rather than a smoker prepare the charcoal in two
piles on either side of the cooking area. * Light with a non-petroleum
lighter, (electric, parafine based
firestarters, or if you were a Scout, you can try the old two match
method.) After all that the cooking is rather simple. In the cavity of
each trout alternate slices of lemon and lime. Either oil the fish or the
grill with as much oil it will handle. It will make taking the fish off
eaiser. Place the fish in the middle of the charcoal fires. Put the soaked
wood on the charcoal, close the lid (and do not open for at least 1 hr.),
and wait. It will take at least 1 hr to cook and possible more depending on
the number and size of the fish. Check it after the hour to see if it is
flaky. If it is not done, serve some more appetizers and wait another hour.
A good rule of thumb is: 1lb trout=1 hour, 2 or 2 lb trout=1 1/2 hour, 3 or
3 lb trout=2 hrs., etc. Use any leftover in a salad with a spicy dressing."

It sounds complicated, but this dish is actually a snap to make. All the
components can be prepared well ahead of time with almost no effort, then
you just combine everything and bake it. The results are heavenly.
Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly oil,or oil-spray,a shallow 9 x 13-inch
casserole dish or a large oval gratin pan.
Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven then add the
butter and let it melt into the oil. Stir in the onion and salt, and cook,
covered, over low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring often. The onions
should be very soft and golden. Add the tomatoes, cover, and cook for
another 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add all the remaining ingredients except the olives, and stir well.
Transfer to the prepared baking pan, cover tightly with foil,and bake for
about 45 minutes, or until heated through.
Serve hot, topped with a scattering of sliced green olives, if desired
Yield: 6 servings Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours (15 minutes of work)
LENTILS: Red lentils cook more quickly and are a prettier color than the
green or French varieties. That said you can use any kind of lentil for
this dish, and it will come out fine. Both the lentils and the tomatoes can
be prepared well ahead of time.
YIELDS: To get 8 cups of cooked lentils for this dish, begin with 4 cups
dried. Rinse them well, place them in a pot with 10 cups of water, bring to
a boil, then simmer until very soft (20 minutes for red lentils; 30 to 40
minutes for green or French). After you measure out the 8 cups needed for
this recipe, you will probably have some left over. You can add the extra
lentils to a vegetable soup, a salad, or some cooked grains.
TOMATOES: Roast about 6 plum or Roma tomatoes -- or 3 large beefsteak
tomatoes.
Roasted Tomatoes : The best types of tomatoes to roast are plum (Roma)
tomatoes and large beefsteak tomatoes that are not too ripe. Cut out the
stems first, then place the whole tomato (skins intact) on a lightly oiled
baking tray. Preheat the oven to 400F, and roast the tomatoes for 30 to 40
minutes. Riper tomatoes will roast more quickly. If desired, you can drain
off juices intermittently during the roasting process, enabling the
tomatoes to cook from inner, rather than from expelled, liquid. (The latter
causes them to stew, rather than roast.) Cool to room temperature, then
remove skins. Seed and mince them. Then measure out 1 cup to use in this
dish. If you are short on time, you can substitute 1 cup canned diced
tomatoes.
SERVE Soft Lentils with any kind of plain grain or pasta -- or simply with
bread and a salad."

Sourdough English Muffins which also can be made as burger buns, and which
don't even have to be sourdough - what more could you ask? Yield: 8-10
muffins/buns =46rom: Ron Parker, inspired by a recipe from Catherine
Devine, Ithaca, NY
In the evening, in an approximately 10-inch mixing bowl put ingedients for
Mix A or b, (not both!) if you don't have or like sourdough breads, use Mix
B.
Mix with a fork, cover with plastic wrap and let sit overnight in a warm
place.
Next morning sprinkle sugar and salt over the bubbly mass.
Then slowly mix in up to a cup of flour. Start with a third to a half cup,
and mix in the bowl until the dough is free from the bowl and has lost much
of its stickiness. Then knead in more flour on a floured surface, kneading
for about 10-15 minutes to get a smooth, silky, elastic dough. Knead in
only enough flour to control stickiness, which will vary with seasonal
dry/wet cycles.
Divide dough into 8-10 equal portions, roll between your hands to make
balls. 8 portions will make nice large-sized burger buns. 9-10 portions
will make standard English muffin sizes or smaller buns. Place muffins/buns
on a cookie sheet well covered with corn meal, allowing some space between
them so they don't touch after rising. Cover with a floured towel, then a
sheet of plastic, and let rise until they are about doubled in thickness.
This will take several hours, depending on how warm the room is.
=46or English muffins: When risen, use a pancake turner to carefully lift
muffins from the cookie sheet and place cornmeal side down onto a moderate
heat frying pan or griddle (seasoned cast iron is great here). Turn the
muffins frequently to prevent burning. They should be cooked only until
light brown, because they will be toasted later.
=46or hamburger buns: When risen, place cookie sheet with risen buns into a
400 degree oven on top of a baking stone slab. The slab is not absolutely
necessary, and if you don't have one use the upper oven rack with a piece
of foil partly shielding the underside of the cookie sheet from the direct
heat of the lower burner on the lower rack. Bake for 12-15 minutes until
golden brown. If you like a lighter bun, make 10 portions, and let them
rise a bit longer."

Goa has developed its own cuisine and vindaloo is one of its main
creations. Two important features of vindaloo are the tech- nique of
marinating meat in vinegar and the use of fiery spices. Although I have
reduced the number of chiles, 4 more may be added if a hotter dish is
desired. Cornish hens may be substituted for duck. Soak chiles in vinegar
for 15 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and blend into a puree. Scrape
mixture into a small bowl. Add cumin, coriander and cinnamon and mix
thoroughly.  Coat duck pieces well with spice paste. Cover and refrigerate
for at least 2 hours. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Add duck pieces and brown on all sides. Add salt, water, sugar and any
remaining spice puree. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring
occasionally, until duck is tender, about 1 hour. Skim off all fat.
Transfer duck to a heated platter, pour sauce over, and garnish with minced

Spelt Pasta;1 c Freshly milled spelt;3  Egg whites;2 qt Water;1/2 ts Salt;Herbs if desired (such as rosemary, thyme, and oregano);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"by Gene Spiller
Choose freshly ground spelt flour or make this from freshly ground durum
wheat flour. If the amounts are doubled, work with half the dough at a time
to shape the pasta.
Mound the flour into a pile on a large pastry board, making a well in the
center. Lightly whip the egg whites and pour into the well. Working from
the center, gradually combine flour and egg whites with your hands until a
fairly stiff dough is formed. Form the dough into a ball and allow to rest
in a covered bowl about 20 to 40 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb
the moisture fully. Roll the dough out into a rectangle on a lightly
floured board. Turn dough several times while rolling as thinly as possible
without tearing. Use a wheel-style cutter to cut strips of pasta.
Meanwhile, bring water and salt to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add fresh
herbs to boiling water if desired. Add pasta; stir gently to separate pasta
strands. Boil, uncovered, for 10 to 12 minutes. Strain and remove herb
stems. Top with Fresh Tomato-Basil Pasta Sauce, or other sauces as desired."

The Story:
The rural origins of Appenzell cookery are evident even in this substantial
honey cake. It is very fashionable during the festivities at the end of the
year to serve a spiced honey cake following the example of the famous
triangular ""Biberli"", which also blends honey and spices. This recipe is
inspired by the ""Bacheschnitte"" which are served on the ""Funkensonntag"", a
spring festival held to exorcise all the evil spirits of winter by fire.
The recipe:
Gently heat the honey in a copper bowl or a bain-marie.
Heat the milk with the sugar separately then add to the honey and stir well
over a low heat. Leave to cool.
Put the flour into another bowl and stir in the honey mixture and then the
other ingredients.
Work all these together to a smooth consistency .
Place a greased flan ring (22 ... 24 cm diameter, 3.5 cm high) on a baking
tray and fill with the mixture.
Brush the top with milk and score a decorative pattern on the surface using
a fork.
Bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 180 oC (test with a needle).
When cold, decorate with icing."

For the stuffed chicken: Arrange the chicken breasts skin side down on a

halve them. Remove the fillet strip from each breast, discard the white
tendon, and in a food processor grind the fillets. Add the ice, blend the
mixture until the ice is absorbed, and with the motor running add the
cream. Add the spinach, the salt, fennel seeds, the rind, the nutmeg and
the pepper. Blend the filling well, scraping down the sides. Turn the
breasts skin side up and beginning at the pointed end pull the skin back
carefully leaving the thin transparent membranes attached along a long side
and leaving the skin attached at the opposite end. Spread 3 tablespoons of
the spinach filling evenly over each breast, smoothing it, and stretch the
skin over the filling to cover it.Chill the chicken, wrapped tightly in
plastic wrap, for 1 hour. May be prepared to this point 24 hours in advance
and kept covered and chilled. In a large ovenproof skillet heat the oil
over moderately high heat unti it is hot but not smoking, add the chicken,
skin side down and season it with salt and pepper. Saute the chicken for 1
to 2 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown, turn it skin side up and
bake it covered, in a preheated 400 oven for 10 minutes. Transfer chicken
to a cutting board and let it stand, covered loosely with foil for 5
minutes. For sauce: Pour off the fat from the skillet, add the Madeira, and
boil it, scraping up the brown bits, until it is reduced to about 2
tablespoons. Add the broth and boil the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.
Mix the arrowroot and water; add to broth, whisking. Simmer the sauce while
whisking for 1 minutes. Holding a knife at a 45 angle slice the chicken
crosswise and arrange the slices, overlapping them slightly, on 4 heated
plates. Sppon some of the sauce around the chicken and serve the remaining
sauce separately. Serve with Couscous Timbales."

BISCUIT DOUGH
A co-worker was cleaning out her desk and uncovered an old issue of Food
and Wine magazine--it's so old, that all the recipes are new to her! Since
I haven't posted anything for quite a while, I thought I' share the fruit
of her bounty with you.
The only problem with this recipe is that it requires the oven and one
minute in the broiler. It is so hot here, that I don't want anything to do
with my oven! The biscuit dough is also used for a cobbler, Strawberry
Spiral Pie, and Cinnamon Crunch Shortcakes in the same issue. If anyone
wants these other fruit recipes, just holler!
1. Preheat oven to 450. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the Biscuit
Dough into a 9-inch round; do not roll any larger. Fold in half and
transfer to a heavy ungreased baking sheet. Unfold the dough and smooth the
edges. 2. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the dough with some of the
melted butter. Arrange the fruit in a decorative overlapping pattern all
the way to the edge of the dough, fanning the slices and clustering the
berries. Dab the fruit with the remaining melted butter. Sprinkle 2 1/2 T
of the sugar over the fruit. 3. Bake the pizza for 20 minutes or until the
bottom is golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and turn on the
broiler. Sprinkle the remaining 1 T of sugar over the fruit. Broil for
about 1 minute, watching carefully, until the fruit begins to bubble and
brown. Slide the pizza onto a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm with Ginger
Whipped Cream.
Ginger Whipped Cream: In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients and
beat until soft peaks form. Refrigerate until ready to use. This recipe
will keep, tightly covered, overnight. Re- whip briefly before using.
Biscuit Dough:
1. In a food processor, pulse the flour, baking powder and salt until
mixed. Add the butter and pulse until, the mixture resembles coarse meal
with particles the size of peas and lentils.
2. Drizzle the milk evenly over the dry ingredients and pulse a few times,
just until incorporated and the dough forms small clumps.
3. Turn out the dough onto a work surface and knead once or twice to gather
it into a mass; do not over work the dough. Gently pat the dough into a
disk or rectangle, as needed. The dough can be made up to 2 hours ahead;
wrap tightly and refrigerate."

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.
Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and any other
flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and
flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim
of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain
the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough
will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.
Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands
primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board
and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the board and

Texas Barbecued Beef Brisket;10 lb Beef brisket;"2 c All-south barbecue rub; see";2 c Basic all-american bbq sauce;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"1. Rub the brisket
thoroughly on all its sides with the barbecue rub, and allow it to come to
room temperature. 2. In the pit of a covered grill, build a very small fire
on one side as far up against one wall as possible. Place the brisket on
the grill on the side opposite from the fire so that none of the brisket is
directly over the flame. Put the top on the cooker, pull up a chair, and
grab the cooler. This is where a person learns about the Zen of Barbecue.
You gotta keep the fire going, but very quietly. If you've got a
thermometer on your covered grill, you want to keep the temperature between
180 and 220 F. Remer, ""Slow and low is the way to go."" You have to figure
out your own personal refueling policy. The one I like is one handful of
coals or wood chunks to every beer.  This goes on for about 8 to 10 hours
or however long you can make it, the longer the better. Don't be scared by
the darkening of the exterior, the outside of the brisket will be
superdark--my personal favorite part. 3. Upon completion, pull the brisket
out, trim off any excess fat, and slice it thin. Serve with barbecue sauce
on the side--no pro would ever cover properly cooked brisket with sauce,
he'd just dab on a touch. Obviously the key here is a tremendous amount of
patience and a day when you want to do nothing but sit around. But the end
product is one of those great culinary events that results from spending a
lot of time doing something that is relaxing and enjoyable. Make sure you
have plenty of tall boys for eating this.
the barbecue process was invented. My research, sketchy as it is, shows
that there was a strong German immigrant communitu in Texas around the turn
of the century. It has some of these Germans working in the booming Texas
cattle industry, and others working in butcher shops, what with their
strong background in butchering and charcuterie. It being common knowledge
that butchers are constantly trying to turn tough or inexpensive cuts of
meat into a usable product that brings a higher cost (witness sausages and
pates), it has these German butchers faced with the brisket. This cut of
beef is particularly unwanted because of the huge percentage of fat that
runs ont only on the surface, but throughout the cut. Traditional technique
would braise or pickle this cut to tenderize it, but the brisket also has a
lot of beef flavor. In my personal opinion, a vey smart German butcher who
ws looking for a way to market this cut barbecued it. We're not talking
here about the that was already popular in this area, but rather closed-pit
cooking, in which the cooking is done by convection ratherr than
conduction. It is similar to braising in theory, with the smoke replacing
the water. It is cooked at very low heat for a long period of time, and the
high fat content protects the meat from drying out but also disappears
through the 10 - 18 hour cooking process. What you are left with is very
tender meat with little or no fat and a tremendous smoky beef flavor. I
think the meat and the process were literally invented for each other.
Now, I don't think that you will get any disagreement from the professional
barbecue industry when I say that brisket is the hardest to master--but,
hey, learning is half the fun. And, in the words of Remus Powers, famous
barbecue aficianado, ""The best barbecue I ever had is the one on the plate
in front of me.""  These are guidelines for the closed-pit barbecuing of
brisket, a basic technique with many variables which is wide open for
personal interpretations."

The Hundred Dollar Chocolate Cake;1/2 c Real butter, or half butter, half margarine;2 c Sifted sugar;2 c Cake flour;1 1/2 c Sweet milk;2  Egg yolks, well beaten;;1 ts Vanilla;1/4 lb Bitter chocolate (4 sqs);2 ts Baking powder;2  Egg whites, well beaten;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Cream butter and sifted sugar. Add the melted chocolate. Fold into
this the egg yolks and vanilla. Sift flour with baking powder and
sift twice more. If butter is sweet, salt will be necessary (1/4 tsp
should be enough). If using salt butter, do not add salt. Combine the
two mixtures, alternating with the milk. Lastly, fold in the beaten
egg whites. Pour batter in 2 greased and floured 9 inch cake tins.
Bake in a moderate oven (350 to 375 degrees) for 30 to 35 minutes or
until cake tests done. Remove from oven and cool before icing.
The original recipe called for 1 cup chopped pecans to be folded into
the cake batter, but we prefer to add them to the frosting. You can
take your choice. I ice this cake with chocolate frosting and add 1
cup of chopped pecans to it. I also like this cake with the pink
peppermint frosting given below.
2 unbeaten egg whites few grains salt 1 1/2 cups sifted sugar crushed
peppermint candy chocolate shot or grated sweet chocolate 5 Tbls.
water 1 1/2 tsp white corn syrup 2 or 3 drops oil of peppermint 1 or
2 drops pink vegetable coloring
In the top of a double boiler place the egg whites, salt, sugar and
water mixed with the white corn syrup. Use a rotary egg beater and
cook the mixture 7 minutes by the clock, beating all the while. Have
the water boiling when you begin to make the icing. When done it
should stand in peaks. Add the oil of pepperming and taste the
frosting to get the right amount (I think peppermint extract would
probably also work in this, Gruver). Color pink with vegetable
coloring. After you put the frosting on the cake and while it is
still soft, decorate the top of the cake with alternating rows of
crushed peppermints and chocolate shot or grated chocolate."
The Ultimate Margarita;"8 oz Fresh lime juice; strained";8 oz Triple sec;12 oz Tequila;"Splash of orange juice (ca. 1-2 oz; to your taste)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Prepare margarita glasses by moistening the edge with a lime sliver, then

comments:
1. there is no substitute for _fresh_ lime juice
2. even if you think the recipe above will be too ""limey"" or acidic for
you, try it...it'll grow on you!
3. there's no need to use a really expensive tequila, but look for one that
has a ""NOM"" code; don't buy the real cheapies that lack it.
4. Triple Sec can be obtained at several alcohol levels; to reduce the
potency of these margies, use a lower alcohol version.
5. if possible, make 12-24 hours ahead and refrigerate; flavors meld
together.
6. for convenience, I use a ""famous-brand"" plastic quart container that is
marked in 4 oz increments.  I strain the lime juice directly into a 1-cup
measure, dump that into the container, add the triple sec and tequila to
the appropriate marks, shake like everything, and it's ready.
7. if you don't want your margies on ice, use a _lot_ more ice in the
mixture and pour into smaller glasses---these are POTENT, and need dilution
as they are consumed!"

MASCARPONE FILLING
GLAZE
Make the eclairs:
1.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.
Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.
2.In a glass measuring cup, stir the eggs with a fork until blended. Pour
approximately 2 tablespoons of the beaten eggs into a small cup, leaving
1/2 cup of the egg mixture in the measuring cup.
3.In a medium heavy saucepan, combine the water, butter and sugar. Over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, heat the water mixture until the butter
has melted. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a
boil. Remove the pan from the heat.
4.Using a wire whisk, stir in the flour, coffee and cinnamon. Whisk
vigorously for 20 to 30 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and pulls away
from the side of the pan. Return the pan to the heat and stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon, cook for 30 to 60 seconds, until the paste
forms a very smooth ball. Transfer the paste to a large bowl.
5.Pour the reserved 1/2 cup of beaten eggs over the paste and beat
vigorously with a wooden spoon for 45 to 60 seconds, until the mixture
forms a smooth, soft dough. The dough should hold its shape when scooped up
with a spoon but be soft enough to slowly slide off the spoon when tilted.
If the dough does not slide off the spoon, add 1/2 tablespoon of the
reserved egg mixture, beat until smooth and retest the dough with a spoon.
The remaining 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of egg will be used to glaze the tops
of the eclairs before they are baked.
6.Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 5/16-inch plain tip (such as Ateco #3)
with the eclair dough. Pipe 5-inch strips approximately 1/2-inch wide on
the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between eclairs. Dip
your finger in some of the remaining beaten egg and gently smooth down any
""tails"" left from piping. Lightly brush the tops of the eclairs with more
of the egg.
7.Bake the eclairs, one baking sheet at a time, for 10 minutes, propping
the oven door open about 2 inches with the handle of a wooden spoon. Reduce
the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and close the oven door. Continue
baking the eclairs for 20 to 25 minutes, until they are crisp. Transfer the
eclairs to a wire rack and cool completely. The eclairs may be prepared up
to this point and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for
one day or in the freezer for up to one month.
Make the mascarpone filling:
1.In a large bowl, whisk together the cheese, heavy cream and sugar until
smooth. Stir in rum.

Take a fresh Jalapeno and slice it almost in half the long way so the
halves are still attached at the stem end. Hold the halves open like an
alligator's mouth and with a potato peeler core out the seeds and membrane.
Be careful not to let the halves split apart.
Mix up the batter.   I use graham flour and water.  Mix to the consistency
thin or thick depending on how much breading you like on the pepper. You
can add any spices you like to the batter. We use none.
Preheat the deep fryer to 400 degrees. The hotter the oil the browner the
skin.
Pull the cheese from the freezer and insert a frozen piece into the pepper.
Run a toothpick on an angle through the 2 halves on the open ends to keep
the whole thing together. Drop the pepper in the batter and get it coated
good, especially at the seams.
Drop the pepper in the oil and leave it in there until the cheese starts
dancing out of the pepper, or until you think it is just about to.
Drain on paper towels and use cocktail sauce for dipping, being careful to
remove toothpick before dipping.

Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil.
Put the chicken in a large bowl with ice water.  Put the yogurt into a
medium bowl. Set both bowls aside.
* The secret to the success of this recipe is to make sure that both the
chicken and the yogurt are very cold (hence, soaking the chicken in the ice
water). The preliminary soaking will help the breading adhere and produce a
crisp coating much like that of fried chicken.
Toss all the breading ingredients into a large, tightly-sealing plastic
bag. Seal and shake well to mix.
Remove 2 pieces of chicken from the ice water.  Roll each piece in the
yogurt.  Put the chicken into the plastic bag, reseal, and shake to coat
thoroughly. Transfer the breaded chicken to the prepared baking sheet.
Repeat the process until all 12 pieces are breaded. Spray the chicken
lightly with the vegetable oil.
Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 1 hour,

THE ""STUFFING
Credit for this recipe must go to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals), who published something very similar for Thanksgiving, 1994.
There are many variations in many vegetarian cookbooks, and this version
uses ideas from many recipes.
Richer than a basted capon, tenderer than a roasted turkey, this dish will
please anyone at your Thanksgiving or other holiday meal. This roast has
two parts: the roast itself plus a middle layer of ""stuffing."" But if you
make it right, everything kind of oozes together once it's done, and the
result is heavenly.
Method: (From the first list:) Melt the margarine list in a medium
saucepan. Cook the onion and garlic in it until tender, and remove from the
heat.
Chop the cashews by hand or in a food processor; cut up the bread as well.
Add the cashews and bread to the onion, then add the vegetable stock, salt
and pepper, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Put half of this mixture into a small,
non-stick loaf pan (or a greased loaf pan if a non-stick pan is
unavailable).
Mix together all the ingredients from the second list. Put the mixture on
top of the stuff in the loaf pan, and add the rest of the first mixture so
that there are three layers of food in the pan.
Place the pan on a baking sheet or in a larger loaf pan (in case it
overflows while cooking), and bake at 400 degrees F for half an hour. The
top should be browned.
Let the roast cool for a few minutes, then turn the pan over and serve the
roast on a plate (or simply serve it out of the pan). Serve with gravy if
desired, keeping in mind that it is a very rich dish.
Notes: The roast will take about an hour to prepare.
The roast refrigerates well and can be frozen for a few months and
microwaved back to life.
As shown, recipe makes roughly six servings.
Vegetable stock is often available in concentrate or as bouillon cubes, in
health-food stores and in general grocery stores. If you really can't find
it, use water, or even chicken stock if you don't usually eat a vegetarian
diet."

the center of the flour mix. Whisk the egg whites, buttermilk, margarine
and vanilla in another bowl. Pour egg white mixture into flour's well,

Very Good Bagel;1 pk Active dry yeast;3 ts Dark brown sugar;1 1/4 c Warm water;1 tb Salt;4 c All-purpose flour;;1/2 c Cornmeal (for dusting);Bagel toppings of choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Proof the yeast with half the brown sugar and all the water. Set aside
until foam forms. Add remaining sugar and salt, stir well. Gradually add
the flour. Knead for about 7 minutes, until smooth and retains a sheen (you
may have to add a touch more water). Cover and allow to rest in a warm
place for 40 minutes.
Dust large cutting board half with flour and half with cornmeal. Turn out
dough onto floured side. Halve dough and then quarter it. Slice each
quarter into 3 pieces. Roll each piece on the cornmeal dusted side, making
a ""snake"" that is a little thinner than a broom handle. Form bagel and
pinch one end around the other. Making them ""look"" like bagels takes some
practice. Place each bagel on a lightly cornmeal-dusted baking sheet. Put
them back in your warm place and let them rest for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Heavily dust 2 baking sheets with cornmeal.
Fill a large, wide pot almost full of water (leave about 1 - 1 1/2 inches
at top), and bring to a boil. Use a wide flat spatula (or one of those flat
slotted round things whose name is escaping me at the moment) to drop the
bagels, top down, into the water. Don't let them touch. Boil on one side
for 1 1/2 minutes, then turn and boil on other side for 30 seconds.
Carefully remove from water and drain bottom down on wire rack while next
batch boils. Move each batch from rack to baking sheet before the next
batch is ready to drain. Sprinkle with desired toppings (I like kosher salt
best, but hey...I'm a native) and place in oven for 17 minutes. Turn bagels
and bake until brown all over, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
on paper towels. Whipped cream cheese is a must"

and stir in yeast mixture and melted butter. Continue to stir until mixture
forms a rough dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. If dough is excessively
soft and sticky, add remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time.
To mix dough in a heavy duty mixer, place flour, salt and sugar in a mixer
bowl, add yeast mixture and melted butter and mix on low speed with dough
hook for about 5 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic. If dough is
excessively soft and sticky, add remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.
To mix dough in food processor, place flour, salt and sugar in bowl fitted
with a metal blade. Pulse several times to mix. Add yeast mixture and
butter and pulse 8 to 10 times until dough forms a ball. If dough is
excessively soft and sticky, add remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time,
and pulse, until dough forms a coherent ball. Let dough rest for 5 minutes,
then run the machine continuously for 30 seconds.
Place dough in oiled bowl and turn to oil all surfaces. Cover bowl with
plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour.
Turn risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface (you may need the
help of a scraper). Deflate dough and divide into two equal pieces. To form
loaf, make sure the surface is free of excess flour, then stretch dough
into rectangle. Fold in short ends of dough until it is approximately the
length of the pan, then fold the far long edge over to the middle. Fold
over the other long side and compress to form a tight cylinder. Place the
loaf in the pan, seam side down. Cover the pan with plastic wrap. Repeat
with the second piece of dough. Allow to rise until doubled. When loaves
are almost doubled, preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack at middle
level. When loaves are completely risen, place in oven and bake for 30
minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and firm and the internal
temperature is about 210 degrees. Unmold loaves to a rack to cool on their

Yeast Raised Sourdough Cakes;2 c Krustez Sourdough Bread Mix;1  Bottle full bodied beer, warm (12 ounces, Alaska Brewery Amber Beer recommended);1/2 c Warm water;3 tb Driy mik powder;1/2 ts Salt;;3 tb Sugar;1/4 c Canola oil *;2  Eggs (preferably at room temperature to avoid cooling the mixture);1 pk Dry yeast (1 tablespoon bulk yeast);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Get up a little early and start this so the yeast has a chance to get to
bubbling. Getting all the lumps out a the start is not critical -- the
yeast will win over the lumps.
Cook on hot griddle and enjoy the smell. These are tender and great with
real maple syrup.
* I usually omit the oil and use cooking spray on the griddle to lower the
""F"" rating.
Notes: Works great with unbleached white flour, wholewheat pastry flour,
mixtures of flour, etc.
Use of beer in flapjack back in the ""old days"" provide yeast for the
pancakes. With the current microfiltered beer, yeast has to be added.
Beer can be replaced with milk -- most of the alcohol does cook off, but
Fick's Law rules and all will not leave in the time that a pancake cooks.
(yes I did a masters thesis on gas exchange in liquid) Those with alcohol
sensitivity should use milk or water.
Increase the oil, or use cooking spray on the irons to make waffles."
